# Q1_Checkpoint_Submission
This is the code and data I used to create my predictive and generative AI models for my final project Q1 Checkpoint. All necessary files are located in the master branch.

DATA EXTRACTION
In order to get the code to work you must download all the data files and put them into a file named Data. All the files are either csv, jsonl, or tsv files. You will need to unzip some of them as they are too large for github. Make sure that the Data folder you create is in the same location as the ipynb files. 

USING THE IPYNB FILES
To properly run the code I have provided you must first download the files and put them in the same folder/location where your Data folder is. You can then open FinalProject_ModelTesting.ipynb and run all the code in it. All the dependencies required have pip install lines to install and then import them to the notebook as necessary. You do not need to refer to the MullerLoop.ipynb, code.ipynb, and WebScraping_Politifact.ipynb files. MullerLoop contains the code for the popular MullerLoop machine learning algorithm, code.ipynb has all the dependencies and necessary fucntions in it, and WebScraping_Politifact.ipynb has al the code I used to webscrape politifact. I already uploaded the webscraped data into a csv file and have provided it here in the master branch so it is easily downloadable. If you run all the code in FinalProject_ModelTesting.ipynb you should get the accuracy of the two models I have created. The report of my work is included in the master branch as well.
